## Authentication integration

No shared authentication implementation exists in this repository. `src/auth/authenticator.ts` is an isolated boundary, not a permanent authentication system. Production rider routes return `AUTH_NOT_CONFIGURED` until the auth owner supplies JWT middleware that verifies the bearer token and assigns `{ userId, role }` to `req.auth`. The rider router independently enforces authentication and the `DELIVERY_PARTNER` role after that boundary.

Use `npm run prisma:generate`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` for validation.
